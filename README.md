# Portfolio Review — Frontend

<p>Project for reviewing and consolidating **frontend development fundamentals**, created as a practical part of the course I am currently attending.  
The focus was not artificial complexity, but **correct structure, semantics, responsiveness, and professional presentation**.</p>

## 🧠 Project Objective

- Reinforce fundamental HTML and CSS concepts
- Structure a simple, clear, and responsive portfolio
- Practice code organization and good practices
- Build a solid foundation for more complex projects

<p>
This project serves as a **conscious exercise**, not as a final product — and that is intentional.
</p>

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript** (minimal usage)
- **Social Media Icons** (imported via JavaScript)

## 📚 What I Learned from Each Technology

### HTML
- Proper semantic structuring (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
- Logical content hierarchy
- Accessibility best practices
- Clear and readable markup organization

### CSS
- Layout using Flexbox
- Responsiveness for desktop and mobile
- Spacing, alignment, and visual consistency
- Separation of responsibilities (structure vs. style)
- Attention to visual detail, not just “making it work”

### JavaScript
- Importing and integrating social media icons
- Conscious use of JavaScript only when necessary
- Avoiding unnecessary JavaScript in simple projects

> **Important note:**  
> I did not use JavaScript to “fill” the project. I used it only where it made sense.

## 📌 Final Note

This repository exists to **learn, consolidate, and evolve**.  
Well-executed simple projects are worth more than poorly thought-out complex ones.
